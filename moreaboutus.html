To this effect, People's Education Trust runs centres in different cities of
Jharkhand, where students stay, get educated, trained and employed through stages
of development and lead the way towards building a better society.

<p>
People's Education Trust is not merely another charitable organisation, it is
rather a movement, a result of the life struggles of its founders, a culmination
of a great vision, a vision to change the society, the lives of millions through
true education, through imparting knowledge, spreading awareness and creating
great minds.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
